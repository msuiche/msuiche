### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the founder of cybersecurity start-up [Comae Technologies](https://www.comae.com) and cybersecurity conference [OPCDE](https://www.opcde.com/opcdex.html) (*OPeration Community Development &amp; Empowerment*). Prior to founding Comae, I was the Co-Founder & Chief Scientist of the application virtualization start-up [CloudVolumes](https://www.brianmadden.com/opinion/VMware-buys-CloudVolumes-Heres-our-full-analysis) which was [acquired](https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2014/08/cloudvolumes.html) by VMware in 2014. His also previous employers include the [Netherlands Forensics Institute](https://www.forensicinstitute.nl/) and [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com).

Some of my most notable research contributions include reversing and documenting the [Windows hibernation file format](https://github.com/comaeio/Hibr2Bin) with its compression algorithm LZXPRESS, the initial research that make [Mac OS X physical memory analysis](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Suiche_Matthieu/Blackhat-DC-2010-Advanced-Mac-OS-X-Physical-Memory-Analysis-slides.pdf) possible, and for presenting and publishing the [first Ethereum smart-contract decompiler](https://www.coindesk.com/first-ethereum-decompiler-launches-jp-morgan-quorum-integration) ([Porosity](https://github.com/comaeio/porosity)) at [DEFCON 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7EcNyuJy2g).

I also, sometimes, appear on TV such as [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-12-04/suiche-says-bitcoin-has-become-so-mainstream-video), [Associated Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1fqUoco6Ck) and digital medias such as [Cyberscoop](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-cure/french-researchers-find-way-to-unlock-wannacry-without-ransom-idUSKCN18F1CA), [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-human-rights-groups-slam-microsoft-for-investing-in-israeli-face-recognition-company-1.7619795), [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/wannacry-ransomware-link-suspected-north-korean-hackers/), [WashingtonPost](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html), [Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xagk4/hackers-connected-to-notpetya-ransomware-surface-online-empty-bitcoin-wallet), [Techcrunch](https://jp.techcrunch.com/2017/06/29/20170628analysts-think-petya-ransomware-was-built-for-targeted-destruction-not-profit/), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/world/europe/cyberattacks-hack-computers-monday.html) etc.
