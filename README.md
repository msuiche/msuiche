### Hi there 👋

Hello! My name is Matt Suiche. I am an independent researcher, advisor, and investor. I previously served as the Head of Detection Engineering at [Magnet Forensics](https://www.magnetforensics.com/). Our organization was passionately dedicated to justice and protecting the innocent, a mission we embarked on more intensely after [the 2022 acquisition](https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/magnet-forensics-acquires-cybersecurity-software-firm-comae-technologies/) of my cybersecurity start-up, [Comae Technologies](https://www.comae.com).

My professional journey began as the Chief Scientist and Co-Founder at [CloudVolumes](https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2014/08/cloudvolumes.html) which was acquired by VMware ([NASDAQ:VMW](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VMW?p=VMW&.tsrc=fin-srch)) in 2014, before founding Comae. In addition, I'm proud to have initiated the cybersecurity community project, [OPCDE](https://www.opcde.com).

My life-long fascination with learning and understanding complex systems first led me to cybersecurity. My teenage years were spent immersed in reverse engineering, which ignited a profound curiosity about technology that continues to this day. I've since explored various fields including operating systems architecture, programming languages, virtualization, modern web application development, and generative art. Furthermore, I've delved into numerous domains such as privacy, surveillance, forensics, blockchain, and community development among others.
